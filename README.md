# Real-Time Video Super-Resolution on Mobile [<img align="right" src="webpage/logo_MTK.png" width="15%">](https://www.mediatek.com/)

## Overview

[**[Challenge Website]**](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/1756) [**[Workshop Website]**](http://ai-benchmark.com/workshops/mai/2022/)

This repository provides the implementation of the baseline model, **Mobile RRN**, for the [***Real-Time Video Super-Resolution*** Challenge](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/1756) in [*Mobile AI (MAI) Workshop @ CVPR 2022*](http://ai-benchmark.com/workshops/mai/2022/) & [*Advances in Image Manipulation (AIM) Workshop @ ECCV 2022*](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/aim22/). Mobile RRN is a recurrent network for video super-resolution to run on mobile. And it is modified from RRN with reducing channels and not using previous output information.

### Dataset preparation

- Download REDS dataset and extract it into `data` folder.

  <sub>The REDS dataset folder should contain three subfolders: `train/`, `val/` and `test/`. </sub>
  <sub>Please find the download links to above files in **MAI'22 Real-Time Video Super-Resolution Challenge** [website](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/1756) (registration needed). </sub>

### Training and Testing

#### Configuration

Before training and testing, please make sure the fields in `config.yml` is properly set.

```yaml
log_dir: snapshot -> The directory which records logs and checkpoints. 

dataset:
    dataloader_settings: -> The setting of different splits dataloader.
        train:
            batch_size: 4
            drop_remainder: True
            shuffle: True
            num_parallel_calls: 6
        val:
            batch_size: 1
    data_dir: data/ -> The directory of REDS dataset.
    degradation: sharp_bicubic -> The degradation of images.
    train_frame_num: 10 -> The number of image frame(s) for per training step.
    test_frame_num: 99 -> The number of image frame(s) for per testing step.
    crop_size: 64 -> The height and width of cropped patch.

model:
    path: model/mobile_rrn.py -> The path of model file.
    name: MobileRRN -> The name of model class.

learner:
    general:
        total_steps: 1500000 -> The number of training steps.
        log_train_info_steps: 100 -> The frequency of logging training info.
        keep_ckpt_steps: 10000 -> The frequency of saving checkpoint.
        valid_steps: 100000 -> The frequency of validation.

    optimizer: -> Define the module name and setting of optimizer
        name: Adam
        beta_1: 0.9
        beta_2: 0.999

    lr_scheduler: -> Define the module name and setting of learning rate scheduler
        name: ExponentialDecay
        initial_learning_rate: 0.0001
        decay_steps: 1000000
        decay_rate: 0.1
        staircase: True

    saver:
        restore_ckpt: null -> The path to checkpoint where would be restored from.
```

#### Training

To train the model, use the following command:

```bash
python run.py --process train --config_path config.yml
```

The main arguments are as follows:

>```process``` : &nbsp; Process type should be train or test.<br/>
>```config_path``` : &nbsp; Path of yml config file of the application.<br/>

After training, the checkpoints will be produced in `log_dir`.

#### Testing

To test the model, use the following command:

```bash
python run.py --process test --config_path config.yml
```

After testing, the output images will be produced in `log_dir/output`.

### Convert to tflite

To convert the keras model to tflite, use the following command:

```bash
python convert.py --model_path model/mobile_rrn.py --model_name MobileRRN --input_shapes 1,320,180,6:1,320,180,64 --ckpt_path snapshot/ckpt-* --output_tflite model.tflite
```

The main arguments are as follows:

>```model_path``` : &nbsp; Path of model file.<br/>
>```model_name``` : &nbsp; Name of model class.<br/>
>```input_shape``` : &nbsp; Series of the input shapes split by \`:\`.<br/>
>```ckpt_path``` : &nbsp; Path of checkpoint.<br/>
>```output_tflite``` : &nbsp; Path of output tflite.<br/>

### TFLite inference on Mobile

We provide two ways to evaluate the mobile performance of your TFLite models:

- [AI benchmark](https://ai-benchmark.com/): An app allowing you to load your model and run it locally on your own Android devices with various acceleration options (e.g. CPU, GPU, APU, etc.).
- [TFLite Neuron Delegate](https://github.com/MediaTek-NeuroPilot/tflite-neuron-delegate): You can build MediaTek's neuron delegate runner by yourself.

### Model Optimization

To make your model run faster on device, please fulfill the preference of network operations as much as possible to leverage the great power of AI accelerator.
